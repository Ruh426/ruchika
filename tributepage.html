    <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan (born Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar; 22 December 1887 â€“ 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician who lived during the British Rule in India. 
    Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics,
     he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, 
     number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, 
     including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable. 
     Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation:
      according to Hans Eysenck: <b>"He tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work,</b>
      but failed for the most part. </p>
      <p align="left"><b>He is known for his great achievement, 
    although he left the word at an early age but leaving the markable works of himself are given as:</b></p>

    <p>"An eqation means nothing to me unless it express a thought of God".</p>
        <p>"To preserve my brains I want food and this is now my first consideration. 
            Any sympathetic letter from you will be 
            helpful to me here to get a scholarship".
         <p>"No, it is a very interesting number,
              it is the smallest number expressible as a sum of
               two cubes in two different ways."</p>
               <h3 style="font-style: italic" >Ramanujan Prize for Young Mathematicians awarded to Carolina Araujo</h3>
               <p>The year 2020 Ramanujan Prize for Young Mathematicians was awarded to 
                   Dr. Carolina Araujo, Mathematician from the Institute
                    for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA),
                    Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in a virtual ceremony on 9th December 2020.</p>
                    <h2 align="center">Early life</h2>
         <p>A child prodigy by age 11, he had exhausted the mathematical knowledge of two college students
              who were lodgers at his home. He was later lent a book written by S. L. 
              Loney on advanced trigonometry.[18][19] He mastered this by the age of 13 while
               discovering sophisticated theorems on his own. By 14 he received merit certificates
                and academic awards that continued throughout his school career, and he assisted the school in 
                the logistics of assigning its 1,200 students (each with differing needs) to its approximately 35 teachers.[14]:27 
             He completed mathematical exams in half the allotted time,
              and showed a familiarity with geometry and infinite series.</p>
